What You See on the Browser (The Issue)
The page displays a list of directories, including html, which suggests that the script is scanning a restricted system directory.
This indicates that the script is still vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, but access is somewhat limited compared to the previous issue.





What Sensitive Information Is Given by This Page
Web Root Directory Exposure:

The presence of html/ suggests this is the web root directory (/var/www/ or similar).
Attackers now know the location of public files and could attempt to access sensitive configurations (e.g., config.php).
Potential Directory Traversal Attack:

If an attacker can manipulate the query string, they may attempt ../../ to navigate outside the web directory and access system files.
