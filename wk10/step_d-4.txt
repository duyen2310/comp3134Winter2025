What You See on the Browser
The page displays a list of system directories, revealing internal server folder names.
This confirms that the script allows unrestricted access to the scandir() function without validation, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.
The script is exposing directories outside the intended web root.



What Sensitive Information Is Given by This Page
Server Directory Structure:

The output lists critical system directories like backups, cache, log, mail, tmp, and www.
An attacker now knows the server environment and where sensitive files might be stored.
Potential Security Risks:

backups/ could contain backup files that may include database dumps, configuration files, or source code.
log/ might store system and application logs that could reveal credentials or system errors.
tmp/ is often used for temporary files and session data, which an attacker could attempt to manipulate.
