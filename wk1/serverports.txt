1. What is the definition of server port?

A server port is a specific numerical identifier used by a server to differentiate between various types of network services. It acts as a gateway for network traffic, allowing data to be routed to the correct application or service on a server.

2. What is server port range?

The server port range refers to the range of port numbers available for use by servers to establish network connections. There are three main ranges:

Well-known ports (0-1023): These are reserved for well-known protocols such as HTTP (80) and FTP (21).
Registered ports (1024-49151): These ports are assigned for specific services and applications by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
Dynamic or Private ports (49152-65535): These are used for ephemeral or temporary connections that are often created dynamically by client applications.

3. How many bits does the number above represent?

Port numbers are represented by a 16-bit integer, which means the number range can go from 0 to 65535 (2^16 - 1).
